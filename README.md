# 20-react-portfolio

Portfolio, redux!

## Description

This module's challenge was to rebuild our portfolio using React. Not only would it allow users (i.e., recruiters, hopefully!) to view my professional portfolio, it would allow me to further my knowledge of React, in addition to learning how to utilize TailwindCSS and Daisy UI.

## Deployment

No app installation is required to view my portfolio. Simply click on the link below to view my deployed page:
